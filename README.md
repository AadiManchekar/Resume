# Resume
You can find Aadi Manchekar's resumes in the [releases section](https://github.com/AadiManchekar/Resume/releases/tag/Aadi-Manchekar).

# Resume Builder
This repository helps me to automate the creation and release of tailored resumes for various roles.

## Features
- **LaTeX-Based Resumes**: Resumes are crafted using LaTeX.
- **Automated Build Process**: A GitHub Actions workflow compiles `.tex` files into PDF documents.
- **Dynamic File Naming**: Generated PDFs are renamed to include the my name for better organization.
- **Release Management**: Compiled resumes are bundled and published as GitHub Releases for easy access.
- **Workflow Triggers**: The automation is activated by pushes to the `main` branch, pull requests, or manual triggers via `workflow_dispatch`.
